The middle loops are stretched and have a form of a flower bud that gives a blossoming and vegetative appearance to the crosses. There are two little crosses in the middle of the big crosses. There is circle under the two big crosses probably representing the Armenian eternity sign (it’s hard to see because of the moss and mold). There are two pomegranates cared near the two triple-loops of the big crosses. Pomegranates stimulate the Christian allegory of fruits: under the sour rind, there are sweet seeds (Petrosyan, H.2008). The right and the left parts and some the cornice interlaced ornaments. There cornice represents three little crosses",
